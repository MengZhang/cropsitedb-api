CropsiteDB API
==============

Overview
--------

This version of the CropsiteDB API supports the following features:

* __Querying__ - Basic querying on metadata fields (multiple fields creates an intersecting query
* __Uploading__ - Upload and verify ACEB files (currently validation is handled by the frontend)
* __Downloading__ - Download a custom dataset. Each dataset it built by user queries

There is a lot to be done yet still, a roadmap is soon to follow.
