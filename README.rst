Overview
--------

The CropsiteDB API is used by the AgMIP community to collect and distribute site-based datasets in
AgMIP's model-ready format. It also allows external data providers to make their metadata available
to the AgMIP community (after collaborating on a common dictionary) through this API.

This version of the CropsiteDB API supports the following features:

Datasets
    The ability to create datasets consisting of ACEB, DOME, ALNK, and ACMO files.

Querying
    Query on ACEB (input) metadata to retrieve datasets.

Uploading

Downloading

There is a lot to be done yet still, a roadmap is soon to follow.

Deploying CropsiteDB
--------------------

1. Download and unzip the `cropsitedb-api-2.0.1.zip <http://tools.agmip.org/download/cropsitedb-api-2.0.1.zip>`_

2. Copy the conf/application.conf.sample to application.conf in a directory above the application root
    This is to make it easier to persist application settings over time

3. Modify the application.conf to suit your environment

4.  Run the server

.. code-block:: bash

	$ <application_root>/bin/cropsitedb-api -Dconfig.file=<path to application.conf> [-Dhttp.port=<port>] &


5. Everything should be running!
